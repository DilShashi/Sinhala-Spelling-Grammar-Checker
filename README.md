Data Collection and Preparation

We have made significant progress in collecting and processing data for our Sinhala spelling and grammar checker. This stage focused on gathering authentic Sinhala text to create a comprehensive dictionary and understand how Sinhala is used in different contexts.

1. Data Sources Identified:

We successfully identified and gathered a diverse set of Sinhala text sources. These include:
Sinhala news articles, which provide formal language and accurate spellings.
Sinhala blogs, offering informal language with varied expressions and common errors.
Sinhala Wikipedia dumps, providing structured content with a wide range of vocabulary.
The data collection process was aimed at building a rich corpus that includes both standard and non-standard word forms. This ensures our dictionary reflects real-world usage, including frequent spelling errors and informal expressions.

2. Text Extraction and Preprocessing:

After collecting the data, we began cleaning and processing the text. This involved:
Text cleaning to remove HTML tags, URLs, special characters, and numbers.
Tokenization to split the text into individual words.
Stop-word removal to filter out common words that donâ€™t contribute much to spell-checking.
This step is crucial as it ensures we only work with meaningful and clean words that will be used to build our spelling and grammar dictionaries.
